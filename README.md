Project for the year 2017-2018

The following processes are being scheduled using a preemptive, round robin scheduling algorithm. In addition to the processes listed below, the system also has an idle task (which consumes no CPU resources and is identified as Pidle). This task has priority 0 and is scheduled whenever the system has no other available processes to run. The length of a time quantum is 10 units.
